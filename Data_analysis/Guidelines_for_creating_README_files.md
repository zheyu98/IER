# Guidelines for creating README files

## README for datasets
A README file provides information about a dataset and is intended to help ensure that the data can be correctly interpreted, by yourself at a later date or by others when sharing or publishing data.

Guidelines of 4TU.ResearchData are shared below and can be also found [here](https://data.4tu.nl/info/fileadmin/user_upload/Documenten/Guidelines_for_creating_a_README_file.pdf).

Recommended minimum content is in **bold**.

 ### 1. Introductory information
- **Title of the dataset**
- **For each file or group of similar files, a short description of what data it contains**
- Explain the file naming convention, if applicable
- Format of the file if not obvious from the file name
- If the data set includes multiple files that relate to each other, the relationship between the files or a description of the file structure that holds them
- Contact information; in case users have questions regarding the data files

### 2. Methodological information
- **Method description for collecting or generating the data, as well as the methods for processing data**
- Any instrument-specific information needed to understand or interpret the data
- Software (including version number) used to produce, prepare, render, compress, analyze and/or needed to read the dataset, if applicable
- Standards and calibration information, if appropriate
- Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data
- Definitions of codes or symbols used to note or characterize low quality/questionable/outliers that people should be aware

### 3. Data specific information
- **Full names and definitions (spell out abbreviated words) of column headings for tabular data**
- **Units of measurement**
- **Definitions for codes or symbols used to record missing data**
- **Specialized formats or abbreviations used**

### 4. Sharing and Access information (not for this course but for instance for a future project)
- Licenses or restrictions placed on the data

Licenses allow you to specify the ‘terms-of-use’ for your data. Check [here](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/use/publish-cite/upload-your-data-in-our-data-repository/licencing) for more info. 

## README for software/code

You should always include a README file at the root of your project. README files include information about:

- The goal of the project (What does this piece of software/code do? For whom is it relevant for?)
- Installation instructions (How can people get the software/code? Are there system/software requirements?)
- License information (If you are going to share your software/code (not for this course but for instance for a future project), what are people allowed to do with it?) See [here](https://choosealicense.com/) for a guide on choosing software licenses.
- Citation information (If you are going to share your software/code (not for this course but for instance for a future project), how can people credit your work?)
- Optional: Issue reporting & Contributing guidelines (How can people help you with spotting issues and helping you improve your software?)

You can use this [README template](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/a-good-readme-template) created by Billie Thompson [PurpleBooth](https://github.com/PurpleBooth) which is also shared below. 

# Project Title

One Paragraph of the project description

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Sample Tests

Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

### Style test

Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.

    Give an example

## Deployment

Add additional notes to deploy this on a live system
